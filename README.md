### Sea-Ice-DeepLearning

This is the updated version of the original Sea-Ice-Reconstruction repo which is removed by accident. However, I decided to fix some issues appeared in recent weeks development and updated everything to this new repo.This new repo is created for later implementations and will be used to keep update codes for further exploring Deep Learning of Sea-Ice Segmentation problems as part of the whole project "Mathematics and Data Science for Improved Physical Modeling and Prediction of Arctic Sea Ice".
